This is a Single Page App that starts with a prepopulated list of resturants, bars, cafe's, etc. within Chapel Hill, NC.  The user can search for other places by keyword (food shops, fast food, etc.) or for a specific place.  The list and markers will update on search with information on all places within the search area.
