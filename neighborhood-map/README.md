#Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

link: http://tytanic.github.io/neighborhood-map/index.html

This is a Single Page App that starts with a prepopulated list of resturants, bars, cafe's, etc. within Chapel Hill, NC.  

The user can search for other places by keyword (food shops, fast food, etc.) or for a specific place.  

The list and markers will update on search with information on all places within the search area. 

Click on an item in the list to view more information from the Foursquare API such as Name, Phone Number, and Twitter handle.
